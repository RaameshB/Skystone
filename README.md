The complete SDK is in the SDK folder. 
If you want just the changes, the module that has the changes is in the changes folder.
If you only want the feature modules then they are in the Modules folder, just merge the changes in the settings.gradle
	with your settings.gradle and you should get my updated feature modules.

If there are any questions please contact me in some form other than e-mail.
